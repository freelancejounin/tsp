The seed and problem number are used to repeat an exact instance of the Traveling
Salesman problem.
When the "Solve" button is pressed, the program quickly finds an initial "Best
Solution So Far" and then uses branching and bounding to find a better solution.
After 60 seconds, the program stops and outputs the best solution it found and the
time at which that solution was found or "initial bssf" if the original solution
was not improved upon.
